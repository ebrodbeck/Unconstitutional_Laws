# Unconstitutional_Laws
An Analysis of Laws Held Unconstitutional in Whole or in Part by the Supreme Court - https://constitution.congress.gov/resources/unconstitutional-laws/

First, I started with this website which has tabulated all unconstitutional laws and their associated details.
## Data Source

## Total Unconstitutional Laws by State

After formatting the data, here are the quick hits relating to the main question. Note that the Federal government has had more than 2x the amount of laws overturned as the highest state (NY). To keep the plots interesting, I'll omit the Federal government from the rest of the analysis.
One might see these plots and say "some states have existed longer, so the data is biased". Good point, lets examine that.
## Unconstitutional Laws per Decade by State

Examining the scatter plot, there is a clear trend indicating that the amount of time a state has existed is correlated with the number of laws it has that were found unconstitutional. To normalize this, both plots show the average unconstitutional laws written per decade (total uncon. laws divided by state lifetime, x10 years). While states like Rhode Island, Delaware, Vermont, and New Hampshire have existed since the beginning of the dataset and had relatively few constitutional oversteps, the same can't be said for New York, Louisiana, and a handful of others.
## Unconstitutional Laws by State and Time

The above visualization shows a heatmap of unconstitutional laws by year, filtered by the top offenders. There appears to be a noticeable uptick in Supreme Court activity during the civil rights movement and onward to the 1990s.
## Unconstitutional Laws by State and Subject Matter
![Unconstitutional Laws by State and Subject Matter](https://github.com/ebrodbeck/Unconstitutional_Laws/blob/main/Unconstitutional%20Laws%20by%20State%20and%20Subject%20Matter.png)

Heat map for the subject matter of overturned laws. Some of the most common include Civil Rights, Criminal Law, Elections, and Tax Law. These are filtered to show the most common categories (there are many more with only a few relevant cases)
